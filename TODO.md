- Add a generator to copy the template view into the user's project.
- Add tests for the controller mixin.
- Use `AASM::Localizer` to produce action names, instead of `to_s`.
- Add a generator for form-based actions that handles verifying the event's existence, stubbing in a pundit policy, adding a controller action, and creating a view.
- Add an equivalent of [responders](https://github.com/plataformatec/responders) for custom actions.
- Add an interceptor to capture exceptions thrown by tasks and redirect to the show action with a warning. (Useful if a user double-clicks on a button and the second actions attempts an invalid transition.)
